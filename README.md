# Loan Data Preprocessing

This repository provides a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline for a loan dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook covers the end-to-end preprocessing necessary to prepare raw loan data for machine learning applications.

## üìÑ File Overview

- `loan_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that processes a loan dataset, cleans and transforms the data, and prepares it for use in ML models.

## üßæ Dataset Description

The dataset used contains various features relevant to personal or business loan applications. Example columns include:

- `Loan_ID`: Unique identifier for each loan
- `Gender`: Male/Female
- `Married`: Marital status of the applicant
- `Dependents`: Number of dependents
- `Education`: Education level
- `Self_Employed`: Employment type
- `ApplicantIncome`: Income of the applicant
- `CoapplicantIncome`: Income of the co-applicant
- `LoanAmount`: Loan amount in thousands
- `Loan_Amount_Term`: Term of loan in months
- `Credit_History`: Whether the applicant has a credit history
- `Property_Area`: Urban/Semiurban/Rural
- `Loan_Status`: Target variable (Y/N)

## üîç Key Processing Steps

### 1. **Data Loading**

- Load CSV or Excel file using `pandas.read_csv()` or `pandas.read_excel()`.
- Display first few records using `.head()`.

### 2. **Initial Data Exploration**

- Use `.info()` and `.describe()` to explore column types and statistics.
- Check for missing values using `.isnull().sum()`.

### 3. **Handling Missing Values**

- Categorical columns like `Gender`, `Married`, and `Self_Employed` are filled with the mode.
- Numerical columns like `LoanAmount` and `Loan_Amount_Term` are filled with the mean.

### 4. **Feature Engineering**

- Combine incomes or create new columns if necessary (e.g., `TotalIncome`).
- Normalize or scale numerical features (optional, depending on model).

### 5. **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**

- Drop columns like `Loan_ID` which do not contribute to prediction.

### 6. **Encoding Categorical Features**

- Label Encoding for binary columns like `Gender`, `Married`, and `Education`.
- One-Hot Encoding for columns like `Property_Area`.
- Use `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder` or `pandas.get_dummies()`.

### 7. **Data Splitting**

- Separate the dataset into features (`X`) and the target (`y`).
- Use this cleaned dataset in a machine learning pipeline (e.g., train/test split).

## üìä Output

After running the notebook, you'll obtain:

- A cleaned DataFrame ready for modeling
- Encoded categorical variables
- No missing values
- Balanced structure for model input

## üß∞ Libraries Used

- `pandas` - For data manipulation
- `numpy` - For numerical computation
- `sklearn.preprocessing` - For encoding categorical data
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (optional) - For data visualization
